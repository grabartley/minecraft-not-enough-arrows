# Build

## Critical Rules

1. Always tie build work to a GitHub issue.
2. Run the `worktree` skill first before any issue moves, coding, or validation.
3. Keep issue project status in sync during execution.
4. Any new gameplay code or behavior changes must include extensive unit tests in the same PR.
5. Unit tests MUST map to a single specific class. Test class name MUST match the class under test plus a "Test"
suffix (e.g. `BeagleCoatRolls.java` -> `BeagleCoatRollsTest.java`). A test that exercises `Foo` must be named
`FooTest`, never `BarRelatedThingTest`.
5a. If the change touches anything under `src/main/java/.../gametest/`, anything under
`src/main/resources/data/more-arrows/gametest/`, or the `fabric-gametest` entrypoints in `fabric.mod.json`,
invoke the `gametest` skill BEFORE writing or editing code. The gametest framework has many sharp edges
(relative vs world coords, time-of-day drift, mock players that aren't ServerPlayerEntity, void floors in
`EMPTY_STRUCTURE`) and this rule prevents reintroducing already-fixed bugs.
5b. Automated QA is a HARD REQUIREMENT before manual QA handoff for any change with a visible or
interactive surface (screens, HUD, rendering, in-world interactions): run the `automated-qa` skill,
verify the captured screenshots yourself, and publish the evidence to the `images` branch with the
raw URLs embedded in the PR body. Hand off to manual QA
only once automated QA has passed. If automated QA is genuinely infeasible for the change (e.g. it
needs multiplayer, audio, or OS-level input), state why in the QA handoff and let manual QA cover it.
6. Run the `pr` skill as part of build after validation passes.
7. Move issue to `QA testing` only after PR is opened and CI is running.
8. After PR creation and `QA testing` transition, always provide a detailed manual QA checklist to the developer.
The checklist covers what automated QA could not; items already verified by automated QA are listed as
pre-verified with a pointer to the committed evidence.
9. If PR code changes after the PR is opened, check whether the PR description still matches the current branch state,
and update it if needed so it reflects the final state only.
10. Stop at `QA testing`, human performs final verification and moves to `Done`.

## Workflow

1. Run the `worktree` skill to create a fresh isolated branch worktree, then perform all implementation and validation
work inside that worktree.
2. Capture scope from the request.
3. If an issue number or URL is provided, read it first with gh:

- `gh issue view <number> --repo grabartley/minecraft-more-arrows`
- Extract acceptance criteria, constraints, and references.

4. If no issue is provided, run the `create-issue` skill to create one before coding. Use the created issue as the
tracking artifact for all subsequent status moves.
5. Move the issue to `In progress`.
6. Implement the feature.
7. Run relevant automated tests and a local validation pass for changed behavior.
8. Run the `automated-qa` skill for any change with a visible or interactive surface: drive the
feature in the live client, capture and verify screenshots, and publish the evidence to the
`images` branch for embedding in the PR body.
Fall back to `run-game-client` for a plain manual launch only when automated QA is infeasible.
9. Invoke the `pr` skill for final checks, commit, push, and PR creation.
10. Wait for CI to start on the PR and report status.
11. Move issue to `QA testing` when the PR is ready for human verification.
12. Provide a detailed manual QA checklist that the developer can run step by step.
13. Every code change must also update any docs it invalidates. Audit `README.md`, in-repo docs under `docs/`, and the
	linked issue body before committing; ship doc edits in the same PR as the code change.

## Board Status Policy

- Use these exact status values from the More Arrows project board:
- `Backlog`: issue created, not started
- `Ready`: scoped and ready to start
- `In progress`: active implementation
- `QA testing`: implementation complete, awaiting human validation
- `Done`: human-only final move after QA signoff

- Required transitions for build flow:
- Start work: set to `In progress`
- After PR creation and QA handoff: set to `QA testing`
- Do not move to `Done` inside this skill

## Related Skills

- `worktree`, required first step for isolated branch setup
- `create-issue`, used when build work starts without an existing GitHub issue
- `pr`, required for commit, push, and PR creation during build flow
- `automated-qa`, REQUIRED before manual QA handoff for any change with a visible or interactive
surface: in-process QA driver, screenshot capture and verification, evidence committed to the PR
- `run-game-client`, manual gameplay launch when a human drives or automated QA is infeasible
- `gametest`, REQUIRED before any code under `src/main/java/.../gametest/`,
`src/main/resources/data/more-arrows/gametest/`, or `fabric-gametest`
entrypoints in `fabric.mod.json` is added or modified. Encodes patterns
from a full audit of the suite and prevents the entire class of bugs
documented in PR #211, #214, #220, #221, #223.
