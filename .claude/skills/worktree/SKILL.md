# Worktree

Use this skill first when starting implementation work.

## Workflow

1. `git fetch origin main`.
2. Pick a short kebab-case branch name, for example `add-beagle-bed-animation`.
3. Create worktree: `git worktree add -b <branch-name> ./.claude/worktrees/more-arrows-<branch-name> origin/main`.
4. Copy the dev `run/` directory into the worktree (required for Fabric dev env client/server launch): `cp -a run/ ./.claude/worktrees/more-arrows-<branch-name>/run/`.
5. Perform all coding, validation, commit, and PR steps from inside `./.claude/worktrees/more-arrows-<branch-name>`.

## Conventions

- Always branch from latest `main`.
- Use a fresh worktree per branch, do not reuse active worktrees.
- Worktree path format: `./.claude/worktrees/more-arrows-<branch-name>`.
- Keep branch names concise and kebab-case.
